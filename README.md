## Experimental Setup

### Camera Device
On a `Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.1` (Broadcom BCM2711, 1.5 GHz quad-core Cortex-A72 ARM v7 64-bit, 2GB RAM), we used the [Video4Linux2](https://www.linuxtv.org/downloads/legacy/video4linux/API/V4L2_API/spec-single/v4l2.html) driver to interface with the camera sensor and capture frames that are then encrypted using [OpenSSL3.0](https://www.openssl.org/). The Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 that we used has a still resolution of 8 Megapixels, a sensor resolution of 3280Ã—2464 pixels, and supports the three following video modes 1080p/30fps, 720p/60fps, and 480p/90fps (respectively video quality and maximum frame rate).

### Android Smartphone
We used a `Nokia 4.2` smartphone with Android 10 on which we have installed the implemented application. In this application, we use C native libraries that we have cross-compiled, and C code to download and decrypt the frames. We leveraged the [MediaCodec class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodec) to perform the encoding and decoding of video files, as well as the [Quirc](https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc) and Bluetooth libraries to perform the pairing.

### Cloud Storage
An `AWS EC2 t3.small` instance was used to deploy a Nginx web server. Upon request, we serve the list of encrypted frames that were recorded during the time frame specified in the request.

## Code Organization


The system (and the code) is composed of the three following components, please refer to the corresponding `README.md` file into each folder for more details: 
1. **application:** Android application used for the performance evaluation
2. **camera_system:** the C source code of the application to install on the Raspberry Pi used as the camera device 
3. **server:** configuration files, database, and basic web interface to upload and download the encrypted frames
